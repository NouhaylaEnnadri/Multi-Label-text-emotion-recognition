# Multi-Label Emotion Detection — GoEmotions (TF-IDF + MiniLM)

This project implements a **hybrid emotion classification system** that detects multiple emotions from text.  
It combines traditional lexical features (**TF-IDF**) with contextual semantic features from a **transformer (MiniLM)**, using per-label thresholds for balanced multi-label predictions.

You can try the model directly here:

##  Model Overview

| Branch         | Features                      | Model                     | Purpose                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **TF-IDF**     | Bag-of-words n-grams (1–2)    | Logistic Regression (OvR) | Captures explicit emotional keywords   |
| **Embeddings** | SentenceTransformer (MiniLM)  | Logistic Regression (OvR) | Captures contextual meaning            |
| **Fusion**     | Average of both probabilities | —                         | Improves robustness and generalization |

## Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the Streamlit interface (usually at `http://localhost:8501`) and enter any sentence to see detected emotions and confidence scores.

58k Reddit comments annotated with **27 fine-grained emotions** + 1 neutral class.
Used here for English multi-label emotion classification.
